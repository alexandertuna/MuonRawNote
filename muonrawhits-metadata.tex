\AtlasAbstract{%
  This note presents measurements of the hit rates in the MDTs and CSCs of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer in 2015 operation. The hit rates are considered as a function of detector region, instantaneous luminosity, and transverse distance from the beampipe. The hit rates show linear behavior as a function of the instantaneous luminosity, indicating good performance. Additionally, the hit rates are projected to future data-taking conditions by extrapolating the linear behavior to the expected conditions in Run 3 and the HL-LHC.
