\section{Hit rates}
\label{sec:hitrates}

Hit rates are defined as the number of hits recorded in a given detector element divided by the livetime and active area of that detector element. The livetime of the MDTs (CSCs) is taken to be 1300 (140) ns, or 52 (5.6) bunch crossings, and the active area of each detector is derived by summing up the active area of each detector element. In the case of the MDTs, these are cylindrical tubes with a diameter of typically 3 centimeters and a length of about 1 meter. For the CSCs, these are strips with a pitch of 5 millimeters and a length of about 1 meter.

The majority of hits in the MDTs and CSCs are due to cavern background, not muons. Cavern background is a mixture of prompt particles from a recent proton collisions and the long-lived neutron gas accumulated from many collisions before and after the collision of interest. TODO: more description of cavern background.

The hit rates for MDT chambers in Run 284285, which was among the longest and highest luminosity runs in 2015, are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hitrates-vs-region-raw}. The average luminosity in this run is $\mathcal{L}=4.1\times10^{33}$. Each hit rate includes all chambers in $\phi$ for that $\eta$-sector. The regions furthest from the interaction point, such as the BOL and BOS chambers, record the smallest hit rate. The regions closest to the beampipe, such as the EIL and EIS chambers, record the largest hit rate.

The regions of the MDTs and CSCs with the highest rate are of special interest because the harsher conditions probe the data-taking capacity of the detectors. The hit rate as a function of instantaneous luminosity in this regions is measured to gauge the detector performance in the presence of increasing particle flux, since the instantaneous luminosity is linearly proportional to the number of interactions in a proton bunch crossing.

The hit rates for the CSC L and S chambers, MDT EIL1 and EIS1 chambers, and MDT EML1 and EMS1 chambers are shown as a function of the instantaneous luminosity in Figures~\ref{fig:hitrates-vs-lumi-csc-raw}, \ref{fig:hitrates-vs-lumi-mdt-ei1-raw}, and \ref{fig:hitrates-vs-lumi-mdt-em1-raw}, respectively. Linear fits are overlaid and provide a reasonable description of the data. The hit rates show strong dependence on the number of filled bunches in the LHC.

At the highest instantaneous luminosity reached in 2015, the hit rates do not show non-linear behavior like saturation. This indicates robust MDT and CSC operation during 2015 data-taking.

In the endcap chambers, the hit rate depends significantly on the transverse distance $r$ from the beampipe. This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hitrates-vs-r-raw} for Run 284285 in the inner endcap, which includes CSC, MDT EIL1 and EIS1, and MDT EIL2 and EIS2 chambers. The CSC hit rates are as large as 800 $\text{Hz} / \text{cm}^2$ closest to the beampipe and as small as 150 $\text{Hz} / \text{cm}^2$ furthest from the beampipe. Exponential fits as a function of $r$ are overlaid and provide a reasonable description of the data. A comparison of the average and peak hit rates in the CSCs are sumarized in Table~\ref{tab:hitrates-vs-r-raw}.
